# WeatherPy Project

This repository holds code to select a random sample of cities from around the world, and then allow a user to search those cities by temperature. We then use the results from that search to create a potential vacation itinerary and provide a map with route information to follow that itinerary. Below are screenshots of the final product. We use weather data from OpenWeatherMap's API. To run the code, save a config file with an OpenWeatherMap key named weather_api_key.
